# statprop
Propagation of a wave function on one potential energy surface 
under the action of a laserfield in the state space representation
(i.e. in the basis ofthe eigenfunctions of that potential) 

The time-evolution-operator   -i*H*dt    -i*(H0 - E(t)*mue)dt
                                 e        = e
is evaluated using the split-operator-technique
(see subroutine propagate)
